            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p> Academic performance is the measure of a student’s achievements in various subjects (<i>Academic Performance - Ballotpedia, n.d.</i>). This impacts a student’s future prospects and opportunities. What’s intriguing is the connection of academic performance to personal life.</p>
            <p> As students, we have personal experiences that suggest that factors in our personal life can shape our academic outcomes. However, understanding the relationship of academic performance and personal life is calling for a systematic investigation.</p>
            <h1>Objectives</h1>
            <p> 	Our objective is to explore the connection between personal life and academic performance. In particular, we will determine whether a student’s relationship with their parents and their relationship status has a direct influence on their academic performance. We measure academic performance through the General Weighted Average (GWA) from last school year (S.Y. 2022-2023) and the number of times the students made it into the Director’s List (DL), which is a very commendable achievement.</p>
